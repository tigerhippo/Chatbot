This is the LHS InfoBot help guide.


INSTRUCTIONS:

To ASK the InfoBot a question, TYPE your question in the text box at the bottom of the graphical
user interface that appears on the screen in front of you.
 
THE QUESTION MUST BE LHS-RELATED. Provide your question as CONCISE as possible, using STANDARD, 

GRAMMATICALLY CORRECT English. If your question DOES NOT receive an answer, try to REWORD it,
 
ELIMINATE more COMPLEX words, and CHECK for all SPELLING or GRAMMAR MISTAKES. If you have NOT
 
received an answer after several TRIES, try a DIFFERENT question. The InfoBot is trying to MIMIC 

the way we speak English NORMALLY, so please enter questions using the words you would use when 

having a CASUAL CONVERSATION with someone (DO NOT OVERCOMPLICATE OR OVERTHINK!). Try NOT to ask

SUBJECTIVE questions.



EXAMPLES of questions that will NOT receive an answer 
(either out of the range of the InfoBotâ€™s knowledge or will not be recognizable by the InfoBot):

How do I get to the town center?  (Not LHS-related)

Are the teachers good? (Subjective)

Where are the languages? (Should say language building, not languages - not standard English)


Note:
Sometimes, you will get multiple potential matching answers for your question, the InfoBot will 
try to give you one answer at a time, please provide Yes or No to let the InfoBot know if an 
answer is correct or not. If you want to start over again, you can type in reset, so that you 
don't need to go through multiple Yes or No steps. In this situation, if you type in other words
the InfoBot will ignore them, until you type in either Yes/No or reset.
